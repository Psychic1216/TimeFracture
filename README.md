  <h2>Game Story</h2>
  You are a man named William Jackson who is an elite agent that is given special extraordinary time powers. You came from the future and  time traveled into the past. Your mission is to prevent suffering in the human world by taking out a powerful international company     named Micron and it’s leader. To do this you must fight your way through the city, get in Micron’s headquarters and clear it out. If you  successfully complete this important mission, you saved the future of mankind. But if not, then no one knows what will stop this from ever  happening and and will keep on going even further.

  <h2>Game Play</h2>
  The way how the game play will work for our game is that it will be a sci-fi, action,
and shooter game. There will be multiple levels in the game and the last level is the
boss fight, these levels will be in box like areas where the level will get harder as you
progress, these levels will many have enemies and obstacles like jumping on different
platforms. The first few levels will be the time to just collect items to help you in the
game like energy shields, power orbs, and health packs that you can use manually. To
exit the end of the level, you will have to complete the required objective in order to
open a portal that will lead to the next level. If you do take too much damage then it will
be game over for you. At the end of the game there will be a boss fight who has time
powers like you but is difficult since you have to complete many objectives to bring him
down and finish him. Besides the ability to just shoot a gun, you also will have powers
that can be used if you have enough amount of power to use it. The powers that you
have are time freeze for a few seconds, time shield which makes a protective barrier
around you, and time blast which would allow you to shoot a powerful projectile at
enemies to eliminate them. Be careful how much power you use because you will start
off with 0 power level but you can get some if you pick up power orbs.
